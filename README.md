# Full Stack Learning Journey

Welcome to my Full Stack Learning repository! This is where I document and showcase my progress, projects, and experiments as I learn full stack developmentâ€”covering both frontend and backend technologies.

## About This Repository

This repository is a personal learning journal and project showcase combining the following:

- Frontend web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks, and libraries
- Backend development: APIs, databases, server-side programming
- Full stack integrations and deployment
- Hands-on projects demonstrating practical application of concepts

## What You Will Find Here

- Code samples and projects built step-by-step as I learn new concepts
- Mini tutorials and notes on technologies and best practices
- Experimentation with databases, REST APIs, authentication, and UI/UX design
- Active exploration of modern web development tools and workflow

## Technologies Covered

Some of the key tools and languages I am working with include:

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Flask, Django basics
